 Project Overview & Core Architecture

Vision:
Build a secure, scalable, and RTL-compliant SaaS platform for Persian-speaking jewelers (طلافروش‌ها), optimized for real-world jewelry workflows such as invoicing, inventory, accounting, and CRM — all within a multi-tenant environment that guarantees data isolation, customizability, and performance.

Key Goals:

    100% Persian (Farsi) UI with perfect RTL layout.

    Isolated tenant environments for data privacy.

    Modular architecture with pluggable services.
